Discussion about the next steps

I only analyzed a portion of the data and thus the observations are limited. There is some more work to be done to make this data useful. 
Here are a few next steps. 

1. First step: extend and deepen the data exploration on the bar and coffee coupons to observe other correlations and make the appropriate visualizations and observations.
2. Step 2: Analyze the other types of coupons (for restaurants and carry out) to explore and visualize correlations, and make the observations.
3. Step 3: Determine if there is any data collected by the businesses/vendors where the various coupons can be used. Explore that data and create visualizations and observations. Combine the findings. One example: find data collected by the coffee houses and explore customer habits related to the time of day, type of beverage, coupons usage, customer attributes. Combine the data and make recommendations on coupons for specific types of beverages, or specific times of day for more focuses coupon offers. 

Recommendations: 
1. Combine coupons offers, such as restaurant plus bar, or takeout plus coffee, addressed to the groups which tends to not accept coupons. 
2. In future surveys add a "day of the week" rubric to provide data on the customer habits according to the work days. It can be interesting to see what day of the week it is more likely a driver accepts a coupon, or goes to a bar, or prefers takeout to dine-in, to give a few examples.
