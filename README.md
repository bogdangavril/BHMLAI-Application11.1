# BHMLAI Practical Application 5.1
The conclusions of this practical application
Focus are the bar coupons
  1. The data set had a number of missing values; the "car" column had to be removed since it contained only a few entries
  2. The other missing values have been replaced by values suggested by related visualizations
  3. Almost 57% of the drivers accepted coupons
  4. Coupon acceptance for cheap restaurants and carry out/take away food was more than double than non acceptance
  5. Coupons for coffee houses were about equally accepted and refused
  6. More drivers refused coupons for bars and more expensive restaurants
  7. Most of the drivers accepting the bar coupon are the ones going to a bar less 3 times a month
  8. The rate of acceptance is higher in the group of drivers going less than once a month and of any age then the acceptance rate in the group of drivers who are older than 25 years and go to bars more than one in a month
  9. The drivers who go to a bar less than once a month, have no kid passenger, have occupation other than farming, fishing, forestry, are more likely to accept the coupons then not
  10. The most coupons are accepted by the group which goes to bars more than once a month and are under 30 years old

Independent investigation conclusions
